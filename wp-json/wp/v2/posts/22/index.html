I see it everywhere, especially on clocks.  I was married to my kids&#8217; dad and his birthday was 8-17.  While we were married I truly believe he had some kind of intimate relationships with 2 women, one his best friend of many years and one he had met through his work at the time. They both were born on the 17th.  I started to have very negative feelings about this number.  I went to a psychic and she told me that I would be happy anywhere but where I was, could go in any direction, even overseas. That was the summer of 2003.  I thought, &#8220;yeah right&#8221;.  After that I found out that where I was living in my southern California city was laid out on a real estate grid\/map as 17.  I met someone living in Western Australia and came to live here!!!  Overseas!!!  Well, I still see 17s, they are pretty much always there, they do come and go, but they are with me a lot right now again, and I am so confused.  I am not happy here in W. AU and want to go back home, where my family is. I have been here 10 yrs and have struggled the entire time. Of course I have aged 10 yrs, and am now 59, have some health issues now, and for that reason it would be better to stay here, but I feel I cannot, I KNOW I should be back home with my 2 (20 something) kids and my brother. It is just not going to be easy in any way to start over alone.  So it is very scary. But I must&#8217;ve come here for a reason. So am I on the right path here, or am I having such feelings, getting more intense all the time, about going home, and that is the right path??  I think so, but I just don&#8217;t know, is it guilt, remorse?  Motherly feelings?  My kids do have their own lives now, and it is not as easy to go and visit as there really is no where to stay (one lives with dad, the other with bf&#8217;s and parents). Does anyone have any thoughts\/feelings?  I am not getting any younger &#8230;. and oh &#8230; does anyone have any feelings\/thoughts on what some are saying about 2017? <\/p>\n<p><span class=\"comment-actions secondary-text\"><a class=\"comment-reply\" target=\"_self\" data-comment-id=\"140518047120042875\" rel=\"noopener\">Reply<\/a><span class=\"item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-130433931\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https:\/\/www.blogger.com\/delete-comment.g?blogID=5005397340711837592&amp;postID=140518047120042875\" rel=\"noopener\">Delete<\/a><\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<p>[ad_2]<br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/sacredscribesangelnumbers.blogspot.com\/2011\/06\/angel-number-17.html\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[ad_1] Oh thank goodness I finally found a place where others are seeing 17.
